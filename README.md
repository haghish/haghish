I am a [researcher at University of Oslo](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BtsIku0AAAAJ&hl=en) and I do research on artificial intelligence applications for mental health. I use GitHub for different purposes, but mostly for developing packages for __R__, __Stata__, __Python__, etc. Below are a list of _free_ software I have written for __R__ and __Stata__. I post updates regarding my software package on Twitter: [@haghish](https://twitter.com/Haghish)
