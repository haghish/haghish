among the statistics community, I'm mostly known for my statistical software in __R__ and __Stata__, and my approach/effort/software to create a path towards a more transparent and reproducible research. I also have tried to encourage the statistical community [making statistical software more interactive](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1536867X19830891). I excessively program with __R__, __Stata__, __Python__, and __C++__. Occasionally, [I blog about data analysis in R and Stata](http://www.haghish.com/home.php). But you find stuff in other languages such as JavaScripts, Objective-C, etc. among my repositories.
