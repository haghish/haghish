I'm mostly known for my statistical software in __R__ and __Stata__, trying to create a path towards a more transparent and reproducible research. I also have tried to encourage the community [making statistical software more interactive](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1536867X19830891). I mostly program with __R__, __Stata__, __Python__, and __C++__. Occasionally, [I blog about data analysis in R and Stata](http://www.haghish.com/home.php).
